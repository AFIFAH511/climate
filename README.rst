`Apache Open Climate Workbench`_ is an effort to develop software that
performs climate model evaluations using model outputs from a variety of
different sources (the Earth System Grid Federation, the Coordinated
Regional Downscaling Experiment, the U.S. National Climate Assessment
and the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program) and
temporal/spatial scales with remote sensing data from NASA, NOAA and
other agencies. The toolkit includes capabilities for rebinning, metrics
computation and visualization. For additional project information,
please check the `project website`_.

Getting Started
---------------

The `project’s wiki`_ is the best location for help and project
information. New users should check out the `Getting Started`_ and `Easy
OCW`_ pages for help getting the necessary dependencies installed. If
you would prefer to have an isolated environment set up in a virtual
machine you should read the `OCW VM`_ documentation. It will help you
get up and running quickly with a fresh VM image for OCW work.

There are a number of examples in the *examples* directory to help users
get started with the toolkit API. If you have questions, the best way to
get help is to email the project mailing lists which can be found on the
[project’s community
page](http://climate.apache.org/community/mailing-li
